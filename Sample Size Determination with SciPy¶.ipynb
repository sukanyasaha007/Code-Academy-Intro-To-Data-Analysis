    "    What number of sale items on a website makes customers most likely to purchase something: 25 or 50?\n",
    "    What color button are customers more likely to click on: blue or green?\n",

Generally, our metric will be the percent of users who take a certain action after interacting with one of our options. For instance:\n",

    "In order to calculate the sample size for our A/B test, we need to know whether we expect our metric to be low or high. It will take more samples to be able to spot a difference when our metric is extremely low or extremely high. Our initial estimate of our metric is called a baseline.\n",

    "Brian the Product Manager has been running an A/B Test for a redesign of Viral Villanelle’s landing page. Brian used the principles in the Sample Size Determination course on Codecademy to calculate a sample size. He needs 1,100 users to view each variant of the landing page in order to be able to detect his desired lift. When he reaches a total of 2,200 visits to both variants, he runs a Chi-Square test. The new website design performs slightly better, but the results are not statistically significant. Brian decides to run the test for another week to see if he can get to significance. He really wants to launch the redesigned website and he needs statistical validation to show to his boss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brian has made a big mistake! By choosing to extend the A/B test past the sample size he needs, he introduces personal bias to the results of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the results had already been significant, he wouldn’t have run the test any longer. If he continues this pattern of preferentially extending the test when he wants a different answer, he will be more likely to get the results he wants, regardless if these desired results reflect reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s sad, but Brian will need to accept that the redesigned website isn’t significantly better than the original website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two important rules for making sure that A/B tests remain unbiased:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don’t continue to run the test after the predetermined sample size, until \"significant\" results are found.\n",
    "    Don’t stop a test before reaching the predetermined sample size, just because your results reach significance early (unless there are ethical reasons that require you to stop, like a prescription drug trial).\n",
    "\n",
    "Test data is sensitive to changes in sample size, which is why it is important to calculate beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the graph in the workspace. It shows an A/B Test where the baseline was 5%, and we want to see a lift of 50% (i.e., we want our second option to have at least a 7.5% conversion rate). A sample size calculator tells us that we need 210 samples. The chart shows the cumulative conversion rate after each new sample. When we reach our desired 210 samples, our cumulative conversion rate is slightly higher than 5%, but the difference is not significantly different (indicated by red). By extending the experiment to 320 samples, the difference becomes significantly different (indicated by green). We might conclude that our results are significant if we stopped the experiment at this point. However, we can see this is a temporary fluctuation. After this brief moment of \"significance\" the conversion rate decreases and our results become insignificant again. By arbitrarily extending the study until it reaches significance, we fool ourselves!\n",

Using a sample size calculator, he finds that he will need a sample size of 1,100. Viral Villanelle’s current advertisement is shown to 500 users per day. What’s the best way for Brian to get his desired sample size?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to remember that Brian will need to show both the old and the new ad to 1,100 users each. If Brian wants to get complete this test as quickly as possible, he could randomly divide users into two groups: half of users would see the old ad and half would see the new ad. It would take a little more than 4 days for 2,200 users to see one of the two ads.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if Brian doesn't want to divide Viral Villanelle's audience evenly? If Brian is running many different types of A/B tests, he might not want to expose users to a barrage of different tests. Maybe only 10% of users should be shown the new ad, in case it performs terribly. By doing this, he would only be getting 50 users per day towards the 1,100 users that need to see the new ad. In this case, he would need to wait for 22 days (1100 / 50 = 22) in order to get his results, even though he would have gotten the 1,100 views for the old ad 3 days into the experiment.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that we own a juice bar called BeetsMe in the small town of Vancucumber. We want to know what our customers' favorite vegetable is so that we know what to base our next juice recipe around. How many people do we need to survey to be confident in our results?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to find a sample size calculator online, but it is difficult to determine what parameters to input. Generally, sample size calculators use 4 parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Margin of error\n",
    "    Confidence level\n",
    "    Population size\n",
    "    Expected proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided an example of a sample size calculator for you in the browser to the right. In the next 4 exercises, we will explain what these parameters mean and how we can choose them to accurately represent our experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Margin of Error\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to have “enough” people for a survey? Generally, we are making sure that our results are within a margin of error of the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is the furthest we expect the true value to be from what we measure in our survey. For example, let’s say we choose a margin of error of 4%. If we get results showing 40% of people love beets the most, we can be confident that the true proportion in the population lies somewhere between 36% and 44%. Thus, the smaller we make the margin of error, the more certainty we have in the results. The larger we make the margin of error, more uncertain we are that they represent the views of the total population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our margin of error smaller, we will need a larger sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sample should accurately represent the population as a whole. So, when we are dealing with a larger population, we should probably be sampling more people.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes tricky to determine what the effective population size is. For example, suppose there are 200 people who currently visit BeetsMe regularly. Is 200 the population size for our vegetable survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "If BeetsMe wants to appeal to the tourists that frequently visit Vancucumber, or if they ever want to launch an online store to ship healthy treats all over the world, the real population size is closer to 8 billion (or infinity, really, if we think about the number of humans who could eventually exist and have vegetable preferences). So, for experiments like this, we use the highest population size we can. Normally, 100,000 will suffice, as changes become negligible beyond that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, for decisions that require extrapolation to an unknown customer base, it is important to understand the preferences of a typical person out in the world, whether or not they are part of your customer base right now. Generally, we use this larger population size of 100,000 or greater instead of focusing on the amount of current customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the small town of Vancucumber is holding an election for a new mayor, and we want to project the results of the election, then the 1700 citizens would be the only important people. In this case, 1700 is the population size we would use in a sample size calculator.\n",

    "Often, before we conduct a survey, we have a guess of what we expect the results to be. This guess could be based upon the results from a previous survey, or perhaps the results of a small pilot study before the real study.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the expected proportion of people with the desired trait decreases, we can survey fewer people. For example, if we are projecting election results and Candidate C has 1% of the voter base, taking a small sample of only 5 people might be fine, because it is very likely that no one we have chosen is voting for Candidate C. This is close enough to the true proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the expected proportion increases, it is rarer that we hit that proportion accurately with the random sample we choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not have historical data, we normally use 50%, which gives the most conservative (i.e., largest required) sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Level\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to choose a confidence level. The confidence level is the probability that the margin of error contains the true proportion. For example, if we choose a confidence level of 99%, we can expect that after multiple repetitions of the survey, the true value will lie within our specified range 99% of the time. As we increase the confidence level, we must have a larger sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We normally use a confidence level of 95%.\n",

    "## Sample Size of a Survey\n",
