## Capstone Project: Biodiversity of the National Parks

Analyze wildlife data from several National Parks. This project will combine material from Matplotlib, Pandas, SQL, and SciPy. You can complete this project either offline (by installing Python) or online by answering questions on Codecademy.com.

For this project, you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform analysis, you'll be creating a presentation to share your findings with the National Park Service.

### Task 1: Analyzing Data

Open biodiversity.ipynb in the browser tab. This will open up your Jupyter Notebook. Follow the steps in the Jupyter Notebook. It will help you do your analysis.

### Task 2: Create a Slide Deck

Once you've performed your analysis, either on your computer or on Codecademy, you're ready to create your slide deck.

Create a slide deck using Google Drive, Microsoft Powerpoint, or some other presentation software. Your presentation should include the following:

* A title slide
* A section describing the data in species_info.csv. Be sure to include some (or all) of what you noticed while working through the notebook.
* A section describing the significance calculations that you did for endangered status between different categories of species.
* A recommendation for conservationists concerned about endangered species, based on your significance calculations
* A section describing the sample size determination that you did for the foot and mouth disease study
* All of the graphs that you created in the notebook

### Task 3: Submit Your Project

* Create a folder containing the following files
* Save your presentation as a PDF using “save as”
* Save your iPython notebook as a “.py” file using File > Download as > Python (.py)
* If you created a video, create a file called video.txt with a link to the video
* If you completed this project on codecademy.com rather than on your own computer, please create a readme.txt file that says “Completed Code in the Learning Environment”
* Compress the file into a .zip
* Upload it to Codecademy
