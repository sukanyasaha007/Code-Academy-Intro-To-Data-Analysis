    "# Statistical Distributions with NumPy\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A university wants to keep track of the popularity of different programs over time, to ensure that programs are allocated enough space and resources. You work in the admissions office and are asked to put together a set of visuals that show these trends to interested applicants. How can we calculate these distributions? Would we be able to see trends and predict the popularity of certain programs in the future? How would we show this information?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to learn how to use NumPy to analyze different distributions, generate random numbers to produce datasets, and use Matplotlib to visualize our findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to generate and graph histograms\n",
    "* How to identify different distributions by their shape\n",
    "* Normal distributions\n",
    "* How standard deviations relate to normal distributions\n",
    "* Binomial distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms, Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "When we first look at a dataset, we want to be able to quickly understand certain things about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do some values occur more often than others?\n",
    "* What is the range of the dataset (i.e., the min and the max values)?\n",
    "* Are there a lot of outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize this information using a chart called a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose that we have the following dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "`d = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple histogram might show us how many 1's, 2's, 3's, etc. we have in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Value</th><th>Number of Samples</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "![](histogram-i-narrative-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we had a larger dataset with values ranging from 0 to 50. We might not want to know exactly how many 0's, 1's, 2's, etc. we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we might want to know how many values fall between 0 and 5, 6 and 10, 11 and 15, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These groupings are called bins. All bins in a histogram are always the same size. The width of each bin is the distance between the minimum and maximum values of each bin. In our example, the width of each bin would be 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a dataset like this, our histogram table would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th>Bin</th><th>Number of Values</th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>(0, 5)</td><td>2</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>(6, 10)</td><td>10</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>(11, 15)</td><td>11</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>(46, 50)</td><td>3</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we were to graph this histogram, it would look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](histogram-ii-narrative-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can graph histograms using a Python module known as Matplotlib. We're not going to go into detail about Matplotlib’s plotting functions, but if you're interested in learning more, take our course Introduction to Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, familiarize yourself with the following syntax to draw a histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This imports the plotting package.  We only need to do this once.\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt \n",
    "\n",
    "# This plots a histogram\n",
    "plt.hist(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# This displays the histogram\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we enter plt.hist with no keyword arguments, matplotlib will automatically make a histogram with 10 bins of equal width that span the entire range of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a different number of bins, use the keyword bins. For instance, the following code would give us 5 bins, instead of 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "`plt.hist(data, bins=5)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a different range, you can pass in the minimum and maximum values that you want to histogram using the keyword range. We pass in a tuple of two numbers. The first number is the minimum value that we want to plot and the second value is the number that we want to plot up to, but not including.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if our dataset contained values between 0 and 100, but we only wanted to histogram numbers between 20 and 50, we could use this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# We pass 51 so that our range includes 50\n",
    "plt.hist(data, range=(20, 51)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a complete example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "d = np.array([1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5])\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.hist(d, bins=5, range=(1, 6))\n",
    "\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Different Types of Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms and their datasets can be classified based on the shape of the graphed values. In the next two exercises, we'll look at two different ways of describing histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to classify a dataset is by counting the number of distinct peaks present in the graph. Peaks represent concentrations of data. Let's look at the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "A unimodal dataset has only one distinct peak. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](unimodal_new.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A bimodal dataset has two distinct peaks. This often happens when the data contains two different populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](bimodal_new.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A multimodal dataset has more than two peaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](multimodal_new.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform dataset doesn't have any distinct peaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](uniform_new.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the datasets that we'll be dealing with will be unimodal (one peak). We can further classify unimodal distributions by describing where most of the numbers are relative to the peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "A symmetric dataset has equal amounts of data on both sides of the peak. Both sides should look about the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-symmetric-noline.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A skew-right dataset has a long tail on the right of the peak, but most of the data is on the left. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-skew-right-noline.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A skew-left dataset has a long tail on the left of the peak, but most of the data is on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-skew-left-noline.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of distribution affects the position of the mean and median. In heavily skewed distributions, the mean becomes a less useful measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SYMMETRIC \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-symmetric.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### SKEW-RIGHT \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-skew-right.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### SKEW-LEFT \n",
    "\n",
    "![](distribution-types-ii-skew-left.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common distribution in statistics is known as the normal distribution, which is a symmetric, unimodal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of things follow a normal distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The heights of a large group of people\n",
    "* Blood pressure measurements for a group of healthy people\n",
    "* Errors in measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distributions are defined by their mean and standard deviation. The mean sets the \"middle\" of the distribution, and the standard deviation sets the \"width\" of the distribution. A larger standard deviation leads to a wider distribution. A smaller standard deviation leads to a skinnier distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples of normal distributions with different means and standard deviations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](normal_distribution.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, each set of data has the same \"shape\", but with slight differences depending on their mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate our own normally distributed datasets using NumPy. Using these datasets can help us better understand the properties and behavior of different distributions. We can also use them to model results, which we can then use as a comparison to real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create these datasets, we need to use a random number generator. The NumPy library has several functions for generating random numbers, including one specifically built to generate a set of numbers that fit a normal distribution: np.random.normal. This function takes the following keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* loc: the mean for the normal distribution\n",
    "* scale: the standard deviation of the distribution\n",
    "* size: the number of random numbers to generate\n",
    "\n",
    "`a = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=100000)`\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to plot this set of random numbers as a histogram, it would look like this: \n",

    "Suppose that we have a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. When we say \"within one standard deviation of the mean\", this is what we are saying mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lower_bound = mean - std\n",

    "It's known that a certain basketball player makes 30% of his free throws. On Friday night’s game, he had the chance to shoot 10 free throws. How many free throws might you expect him to make? We would expect 0.30 * 10 = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, he actually made 4 free throws out of 10 or 40%. Is this surprising? Does this mean that he’s actually better than we thought?\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution can help us. It tells us how likely it is for a certain number of “successes” to happen, given a probability of success and a number of trials.\n",

    "* The probability of success was 30% (he makes 30% of free throws)\n",
    "* The number of trials was 10 (he took 10 shots)\n",
    "* The number of successes was 4 (he made 4 shots)\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is important because it allows us to know how likely a certain outcome is, even when it's not the expected one. From this graph, we can see that it's not that unlikely an outcome for our basketball player to get 4 free throws out of 10. However, it would be pretty unlikely for him to get all 10. \n",

We can use these random numbers to model a distribution of numerical data that matches the real-life scenario we're interested in understanding.\n",

    "For instance, suppose we want to know the different probabilities of our basketball player making 1, 2, 3, etc. out of 10 shots.\n",

    "* P: The probability of success\n",
    "* size: The number of experiments\n",
    "\n",
